C<IO::Async::Process> - start and manage a child process

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use IO::Async::Process;

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

 my $process = IO::Async::Process->new(
    command => [ "tr", "a-z", "n-za-m" ],
    stdin => {
       from => "hello world\n",
    },
    stdout => {
       on_read => sub {
          my ( $stream, $buffref ) = @_;
          while( $$buffref =~ s/^(.*)\n// ) {
             print "Rot13 of 'hello world' is '$1'\n";
          }
          
          return 0;
       },

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This subclass of L<IO::Async::Notifier> starts a child process, and invokes a
callback when it exits. The child process can either execute a given block of
code (via C<fork(2)>), or a command.

=cut

=head1 EVENTS

The following events are invoked, either using subclass methods or CODE
references in parameters:

=head2 on_finish $exitcode

Invoked after the process has exited by normal means (i.e. an C<exit(2)>
syscall from a process, or C<return>ing from the code block), and has closed
all its file descriptors.

=head2 on_exception $exception, $errno, $exitcode

Invoked when the process exits by an exception from C<code>, or by failing to
C<exec(2)> the given command. C<$errno> will be a dualvar, containing both
number and string values.

Note that this has a different name and a different argument order from
C<< Loop->open_child >>'s C<on_error>.

If this is not provided and the process exits with an exception, then
C<on_finish> is invoked instead, being passed just the exit code.

=cut

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=cut

=head2 $process = IO::Async::Process->new( %args )

Constructs a new C<IO::Async::Process> object and returns it.

Once constructed, the C<Process> will need to be added to the C<Loop> before
the child process is started.

=cut

sub _init
{
   my $self = shift;
   $self->SUPER::_init( @_ );

   $self->{to_close}   = {};
   $self->{finish_futures} = [];
}

=head1 PARAMETERS

The following named parameters may be passed to C<new> or C<configure>:

=over 8

=item on_finish => CODE

=item on_exception => CODE

CODE reference for the event handlers.

=back

Once the C<on_finish> continuation has been invoked, the C<IO::Async::Process>
object is removed from the containing C<IO::Async::Loop> object.

The following parameters may be passed to C<new>, or to C<configure> before
the process has been started (i.e. before it has been added to the C<Loop>).
Once the process is running these cannot be changed.

=over 8

=item command => ARRAY or STRING

Either a reference to an array containing the command and its arguments, or a
plain string containing the command. This value is passed into perl's
C<exec(2)> function.

=item code => CODE

A block of code to execute in the child process. It will be called in scalar
context inside an C<eval> block.

=item setup => ARRAY

Optional reference to an array to pass to the underlying C<Loop>
C<spawn_child> method.

=item fdI<n> => HASH

A hash describing how to set up file descriptor I<n>. The hash may contain the
following keys:

=over 4

=item via => STRING

Configures how this file descriptor will be configured for the child process.
Must be given one of the following mode names:

=over 4

=item pipe_read

The child will be given the writing end of a C<pipe(2)>; the parent may read
from the other.

=item pipe_write

The child will be given the reading end of a C<pipe(2)>; the parent may write
to the other. Since an EOF condition of this kind of handle cannot reliably be
detected, C<on_finish> will not wait for this type of pipe to be closed.

=item pipe_rdwr

Only valid on the C<stdio> filehandle. The child will be given the reading end
of one C<pipe(2)> on STDIN and the writing end of another on STDOUT. A single
Stream object will be created in the parent configured for both filehandles.

=item socketpair

The child will be given one end of a C<socketpair(2)>; the parent will be
given the other. The family of this socket may be given by the extra key
called C<family>; defaulting to C<unix>. The socktype of this socket may be
given by the extra key called C<socktype>; defaulting to C<stream>. If the
type is not C<SOCK_STREAM> then a L<IO::Async::Socket> object will be
constructed for the parent side of the handle, rather than
C<IO::Async::Stream>.

=back

Once the filehandle is set up, the C<fd> method (or its shortcuts of C<stdin>,
C<stdout> or C<stderr>) may be used to access the
C<IO::Async::Handle>-subclassed object wrapped around it.

The value of this argument is implied by any of the following alternatives.

=item on_read => CODE

The child will be given the writing end of a pipe. The reading end will be
wrapped by an C<IO::Async::Stream> using this C<on_read> callback function.

=item into => SCALAR

The child will be given the writing end of a pipe. The referenced scalar will
be filled by data read from the child process. This data may not be available
until the pipe has been closed by the child.

=item from => STRING

The child will be given the reading end of a pipe. The string given by the
C<from> parameter will be written to the child. When all of the data has been
written the pipe will be closed.

=back

=item stdin => ...

=item stdout => ...

=item stderr => ...

Shortcuts for C<fd0>, C<fd1> and C<fd2> respectively.

=item stdio => ...

Special filehandle to affect STDIN and STDOUT at the same time. This
filehandle supports being configured for both reading and writing at the same
time.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 $pid = $process->pid

Returns the process ID of the process, if it has been started, or C<undef> if
not. Its value is preserved after the process exits, so it may be inspected
during the C<on_finish> or C<on_exception> events.

=cut

sub pid
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{pid};
}

=head2 $process->kill( $signal )

Sends a signal to the process

=cut

sub kill
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $signal ) = @_;

   kill $signal, $self->pid or croak "Cannot kill() - $!";
}

=head2 $running = $process->is_running

Returns true if the Process has been started, and has not yet finished.

=cut

sub is_running
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{running};
}

=head2 $exited = $process->is_exited

Returns true if the Process has finished running, and finished due to normal
C<exit(2)>.

=cut

sub is_exited
{
   my $self = shift;
   return defined $self->{exitcode} ? WIFEXITED( $self->{exitcode} ) : undef;
}

=head2 $status = $process->exitstatus

If the process exited due to normal C<exit(2)>, returns the value that was
passed to C<exit(2)>. Otherwise, returns C<undef>.

=cut

sub exitstatus
{
   my $self = shift;
   return defined $self->{exitcode} ? WEXITSTATUS( $self->{exitcode} ) : undef;
}

=head2 $exception = $process->exception

If the process exited due to an exception, returns the exception that was
thrown. Otherwise, returns C<undef>.

=cut

sub exception
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{dollarat};
}

=head2 $errno = $process->errno

If the process exited due to an exception, returns the numerical value of
C<$!> at the time the exception was thrown. Otherwise, returns C<undef>.

=cut

sub errno
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{dollarbang}+0;
}

=head2 $errstr = $process->errstr

If the process exited due to an exception, returns the string value of
C<$!> at the time the exception was thrown. Otherwise, returns C<undef>.

=cut

sub errstr
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{dollarbang}."";
}

=head2 $stream = $process->fd( $fd )

Returns the L<IO::Async::Stream> or L<IO::Async::Socket> associated with the
given FD number. This must have been set up by a C<configure> argument prior
to adding the C<Process> object to the C<Loop>.

The returned object have its read or write handle set to the other end of a
pipe or socket connected to that FD number in the child process. Typically,
this will be used to call the C<write> method on, to write more data into the
child, or to set an C<on_read> handler to read data out of the child.

The C<on_closed> event for these streams must not be changed, or it will break
the close detection used by the C<Process> object and the C<on_finish> event
will not be invoked.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Capturing the STDOUT stream of a process

By configuring the C<stdout> filehandle of the process using the C<into> key,
data written by the process can be captured.

 my $stdout;
 my $process = IO::Async::Process->new(
    command => [ "writing-program", "arguments" ],
    stdout => { into => \$stdout },
    on_finish => sub {
       print "The process has finished, and wrote:\n";
       print $stdout;
    }
 );

 $loop->add( $process );

Note that until C<on_finish> is invoked, no guarantees are made about how much
of the data actually written by the process is yet in the C<$stdout> scalar.

See also the C<run_child> method of L<IO::Async::Loop>.

To handle data more interactively as it arrives, the C<on_read> key can
instead be used, to provide a callback function to invoke whenever more data
is available from the process.

 my $process = IO::Async::Process->new(
    command => [ "writing-program", "arguments" ],
    stdout => {
       on_read => sub {
          my ( $stream, $buffref ) = @_;
          while( $$buffref =~ s/^(.*)\n// ) {
             print "The process wrote a line: $1\n";
          }

          return 0;
       },
    },
    on_finish => sub {
       print "The process has finished\n";
    }
 );

 $loop->add( $process );

If the code to handle data read from the process isn't available yet when
the object is constructed, it can be supplied later by using the C<configure>
method on the C<stdout> filestream at some point before it gets added to the
Loop. In this case, C<stdin> should be configured using C<pipe_read> in the
C<via> key.

 my $process = IO::Async::Process->new(
    command => [ "writing-program", "arguments" ],

=head2 Sending data to STDIN of a process

By configuring the C<stdin> filehandle of the process using the C<from> key,
data can be written into the C<STDIN> stream of the process.

 my $process = IO::Async::Process->new(
    command => [ "reading-program", "arguments" ],
    stdin => { from => "Here is the data to send\n" },
    on_finish => sub { 
       print "The process has finished\n";
    }
 );

 $loop->add( $process );

The data in this scalar will be written until it is all consumed, then the
handle will be closed. This may be useful if the program waits for EOF on
C<STDIN> before it exits.

To have the ability to write more data into the process once it has started.
the C<write> method on the C<stdin> stream can be used, when it is configured
using the C<pipe_write> value for C<via>:

 my $process = IO::Async::Process->new(
    command => [ "reading-program", "arguments" ],
    stdin => { via => "pipe_write" },
    on_finish => sub { 
       print "The process has finished\n";
    }
 );

 $loop->add( $process );

 $process->stdin->write( "Here is some more data\n" );
