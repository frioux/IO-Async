=head1 NAME

C<IO::Async::File> - watch a file for changes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use IO::Async::File;

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

 my $file = IO::Async::File->new(
    filename => "config.ini",
    on_mtime_changed => sub {
       my ( $self ) = @_;
       print STDERR "Config file has changed\n";
       reload_config( $self->handle );
    }
 );

 $loop->add( $file );

 $loop->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This subclass of L<IO::Async::Notifier> watches an open filehandle or named
filesystem entity for changes in its C<stat()> fields. It invokes various
events when the values of these fields change. It is most often used to watch
a file for size changes; for this task see also L<IO::Async::FileStream>.

While called "File", it is not required that the watched filehandle be a
regular file. It is possible to watch anything that C<stat(2)> may be called
on, such as directories or other filesystem entities.

=head1 EVENTS

The following events are invoked, either using subclass methods or CODE
references in parameters.

=head2 on_dev_changed $new_dev, $old_dev

=head2 on_ino_changed $new_ino, $old_ino

=head2 ...

=head2 on_ctime_changed $new_ctime, $old_ctime

Invoked when each of the individual C<stat()> fields have changed. All the
C<stat()> fields are supported apart from C<blocks> and C<blksize>. Each is
passed the new and old values of the field.

=head2 on_devino_changed $new_stat, $old_stat

Invoked when either of the C<dev> or C<ino> fields have changed. It is passed
two L<File::stat> instances containing the complete old and new C<stat()>
fields. This can be used to observe when a named file is renamed; it will not
be observed to happen on opened filehandles.

=head2 on_stat_changed $new_stat, $old_stat

Invoked when any of the C<stat()> fields have changed. It is passed two
L<File::stat> instances containing the old and new C<stat()> fields.

=cut

=head1 PARAMETERS

The following named parameters may be passed to C<new> or C<configure>.

=over 8

=item handle => IO

The opened filehandle to watch for C<stat()> changes if C<filename> is not
supplied.

=item filename => STRING

Optional. If supplied, watches the named file rather than the filehandle given
in C<handle>. The file will be opened for reading and then watched for
renames. If the file is renamed, the new filename is opened and tracked
similarly after closing the previous file.

=item interval => NUM

Optional. The interval in seconds to poll the filehandle using C<stat(2)>
looking for size changes. A default of 2 seconds will be applied if not
defined.

=cut

=head2 $handle = $file->handle

passed to the C<handle> parameter, or opened from the C<filename> parameter.

=cut

sub handle
{
   my $self = shift;
   return $self->{handle};
