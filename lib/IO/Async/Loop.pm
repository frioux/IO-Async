 use IO::Async::Timer::Countdown;

 use IO::Async::Loop;

 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

 $loop->add( IO::Async::Timer::Countdown->new(

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an abstract class which implements the core loop of the
C<IO::Async> framework. Its primary purpose is to store a set of
L<IO::Async::Notifier> objects or subclasses of them. It handles all of the
lower-level set manipulation actions, and leaves the actual IO readiness 
testing/notification to the concrete class that implements it. It also
provides other functionality such as signal handling, child process managing,
and timers.

See also the two bundled Loop subclasses:

=over 4

=item L<IO::Async::Loop::Select>

=item L<IO::Async::Loop::Poll>

=back

Or other subclasses that may appear on CPAN which are not part of the core
C<IO::Async> distribution.

=head1 MAGIC CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new

This function attempts to find a good subclass to use, then calls its
constructor. It works by making a list of likely candidate classes, then
trying each one in turn, C<require>ing the module then calling its C<new>
method. If either of these operations fails, the next subclass is tried. If
no class was successful, then an exception is thrown.

The constructed object is cached, and will be returned again by a subsequent
call. The cache will also be set by a constructor on a specific subclass. This
behaviour makes it possible to simply use the normal constructor in a module
that wishes to interract with the main program's Loop, such as an integration
module for another event system.

For example, the following two C<$loop> variables will refer to the same
object:

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 use IO::Async::Loop::Poll;

 my $loop_poll = IO::Async::Loop::Poll->new;

 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

While it is not advised to do so under normal circumstances, if the program
really wishes to construct more than one Loop object, it can call the
constructor C<really_new>, or invoke one of the subclass-specific constructors
directly.

The list of candidates is formed from the following choices, in this order:

=over 4

=item * $ENV{IO_ASYNC_LOOP}

If this environment variable is set, it should contain a comma-separated list
of subclass names. These names may or may not be fully-qualified; if a name
does not contain C<::> then it will have C<IO::Async::Loop::> prepended to it.
This allows the end-user to specify a particular choice to fit the needs of
his use of a program using C<IO::Async>.

=item * $IO::Async::Loop::LOOP

If this scalar is set, it should contain a comma-separated list of subclass
names. These may or may not be fully-qualified, as with the above case. This
allows a program author to suggest a loop module to use.

In cases where the module subclass is a hard requirement, such as GTK programs
using C<Glib>, it would be better to use the module specifically and invoke
its constructor directly.

=item * $^O

The module called C<IO::Async::Loop::$^O> is tried next. This allows specific
OSes, such as the ever-tricky C<MSWin32>, to provide an implementation that
might be more efficient than the generic ones, or even work at all.

=item * Poll and Select

Finally, if no other choice has been made by now, the built-in C<Poll> module
is chosen. This should always work, but in case it doesn't, the C<Select>
module will be chosen afterwards as a last-case attempt. If this also fails,
then the magic constructor itself will throw an exception.

=back

If any of the explicitly-requested loop types (C<$ENV{IO_ASYNC_LOOP}> or
C<$IO::Async::Loop::LOOP>) fails to load then a warning is printed detailing
the error.

Implementors of new C<IO::Async::Loop> subclasses should see the notes about
C<API_VERSION> below.

# Notifier management #
#######################

=head1 NOTIFIER MANAGEMENT

The following methods manage the collection of C<IO::Async::Notifier> objects.

=cut

=head2 $loop->add( $notifier )

This method adds another notifier object to the stored collection. The object
may be a C<IO::Async::Notifier>, or any subclass of it.

When a notifier is added, any children it has are also added, recursively. In
this way, entire sections of a program may be written within a tree of
notifier objects, and added or removed on one piece.

=cut

sub add
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $notifier ) = @_;

   if( defined $notifier->parent ) {
      croak "Cannot add a child notifier directly - add its parent";
   }

   if( defined $notifier->loop ) {
      croak "Cannot add a notifier that is already a member of a loop";
   }

   $self->_add_noparentcheck( $notifier );
}

sub _add_noparentcheck
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $notifier ) = @_;

   my $nkey = refaddr $notifier;

   $self->{notifiers}->{$nkey} = $notifier;

   $notifier->__set_loop( $self );

   $self->_add_noparentcheck( $_ ) for $notifier->children;

   return;
}

=head2 $loop->remove( $notifier )

This method removes a notifier object from the stored collection, and
recursively and children notifiers it contains.

=cut

sub remove
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $notifier ) = @_;

   if( defined $notifier->parent ) {
      croak "Cannot remove a child notifier directly - remove its parent";
   }

   $self->_remove_noparentcheck( $notifier );
}

sub _remove_noparentcheck
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $notifier ) = @_;

   my $nkey = refaddr $notifier;

   exists $self->{notifiers}->{$nkey} or croak "Notifier does not exist in collection";

   delete $self->{notifiers}->{$nkey};

   $notifier->__set_loop( undef );

   $self->_remove_noparentcheck( $_ ) for $notifier->children;

   return;
}

=head2 @notifiers = $loop->notifiers

Returns a list of all the notifier objects currently stored in the Loop.

=cut

sub notifiers
{
   my $self = shift;
   # Sort so the order remains stable under additions/removals
   return map { $self->{notifiers}->{$_} } sort keys %{ $self->{notifiers} };

# Looping support #
###################

=head1 LOOPING CONTROL

The following methods control the actual run cycle of the loop, and hence the
program.

=cut

=head2 $count = $loop->loop_once( $timeout )

This method performs a single wait loop using the specific subclass's
underlying mechanism. If C<$timeout> is undef, then no timeout is applied, and
it will wait until an event occurs. The intention of the return value is to
indicate the number of callbacks that this loop executed, though different
subclasses vary in how accurately they can report this. See the documentation
for this method in the specific subclass for more information.

=cut

sub loop_once
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $timeout ) = @_;

   croak "Expected that $self overrides ->loop_once";
}

=head2 @result = $loop->run

=head2 $result = $loop->run

Runs the actual IO event loop. This method blocks until the C<stop> method is
called, and returns the result that was passed to C<stop>. In scalar context
only the first result is returned; the others will be discarded if more than
one value was provided. This method may be called recursively.

This method is a recent addition and may not be supported by all the
C<IO::Async::Loop> subclasses currently available on CPAN.

=cut

sub run
{
   my $self = shift;

   local $self->{running} = 1;
   local $self->{result} = [];

   while( $self->{running} ) {
      $self->loop_once( undef );
   }

   return wantarray ? @{ $self->{result} } : $self->{result}[0];
}

=head2 $loop->stop( @result )

Stops the inner-most C<run> method currently in progress, causing it to return
the given C<@result>.

This method is a recent addition and may not be supported by all the
C<IO::Async::Loop> subclasses currently available on CPAN.

=cut

sub stop
{
   my $self = shift;

   @{ $self->{result} } = @_;
   undef $self->{running};
}

=head2 $loop->loop_forever

A synonym for C<run>, though this method does not return a result.

=cut

sub loop_forever
{
   my $self = shift;
   $self->run;
   return;
}

=head2 $loop->loop_stop

A synonym for C<stop>, though this method does not pass any results.

=cut

sub loop_stop
{
   my $self = shift;

}

###########
# Futures #
###########

=head1 FUTURE SUPPORT

The following methods relate to L<IO::Async::Future> objects.

=cut

=head2 $future = $loop->new_future

Returns a new C<IO::Async::Future> instance with a reference to the Loop.

=cut

sub new_future
{
   my $self = shift;
   require IO::Async::Future;
   return IO::Async::Future->new( $self );
}

=head2 $loop->await( $future )

Blocks until the given future is ready, as indicated by its C<is_ready> method.
As a convenience it returns the future, to simplify code:

 my @result = $loop->await( $future )->get;

=cut

sub await
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $future ) = @_;

   $self->loop_once until $future->is_ready;

   return $future;
}

=head2 $loop->await_all( @futures )

Blocks until all the given futures are ready, as indicated by the C<is_ready>
method. Equivalent to calling C<await> on a C<< Future->wait_all >> except
that it doesn't create the surrounding future object.

=cut

sub _all_ready { $_->is_ready or return 0 for @_; return 1  }

sub await_all
{
   my $self = shift;
   my @futures = @_;

   $self->loop_once until _all_ready @futures;
}

=head2 $future = $loop->delay_future( %args )

Returns a new C<IO::Async::Future> instance which will become done at a given
point in time. The C<%args> should contain an C<at> or C<after> key as per the
C<watch_time> method. The returned future may be cancelled to cancel the
timer. At the alloted time the future will succeed with an empty result list.

=cut

sub delay_future
{
   my $self = shift;
   my %args = @_;

   my $future = $self->new_future;
   my $id = $self->watch_time( %args,
      code => sub { $future->done },
   );

   $future->on_cancel( sub { shift->loop->unwatch_time( $id ) } );

   return $future;
}

=head2 $future = $loop->timeout_future( %args )

Returns a new C<IO::Async::Future> instance which will fail at a given point
in time. The C<%args> should contain an C<at> or C<after> key as per the
C<watch_time> method. The returned future may be cancelled to cancel the
timer. At the alloted time, the future will fail with the string C<"Timeout">.

=cut

sub timeout_future
{
   my $self = shift;
   my %args = @_;

   my $future = $self->new_future;
   my $id = $self->watch_time( %args,

############
# Features #
############

=head1 FEATURES

Most of the following methods are higher-level wrappers around base
functionality provided by the low-level API documented below. They may be
used by C<IO::Async::Notifier> subclasses or called directly by the program.

=cut

   # go on report its caller. To make this work, add the feature class to our
   # @CARP_NOT list.
   push our(@CARP_NOT), $classname;

   return $classname->new( loop => $self );
}

=head2 $id = $loop->attach_signal( $signal, $code )

This method adds a new signal handler to watch the given signal. The same
signal can be attached to multiple times; its callback functions will all be
invoked, in no particular order.

The returned C<$id> value can be used to identify the signal handler in case
it needs to be removed by the C<detach_signal> method. Note that this value
may be an object reference, so if it is stored, it should be released after it
cancelled, so the object itself can be freed.

=over 8

=item $signal

The name of the signal to attach to. This should be a bare name like C<TERM>.

=item $code

A CODE reference to the handling callback.

=back

Attaching to C<SIGCHLD> is not recommended because of the way all child
processes use it to report their termination. Instead, the C<watch_child>
method should be used to watch for termination of a given child process. A
warning will be printed if C<SIGCHLD> is passed here, but in future versions
of C<IO::Async> this behaviour may be disallowed altogether.

See also L<POSIX> for the C<SIGI<name>> constants.

For a more flexible way to use signals from within Notifiers, see instead the
L<IO::Async::Signal> object.

Removes a previously-attached signal handler.

      delete $self->{sigattaches}->{$signal};
   }
}

=head2 $loop->later( $code )

Schedules a code reference to be invoked as soon as the current round of IO
operations is complete.

The code reference is never invoked immediately, though the loop will not
perform any blocking operations between when it is installed and when it is
invoked. It may call C<select>, C<poll> or equivalent with a zero-second
timeout, and process any currently-pending IO conditions before the code is
invoked, but it will not block for a non-zero amount of time.

This method is implemented using the C<watch_idle> method, with the C<when>
parameter set to C<later>. It will return an ID value that can be passed to
C<unwatch_idle> if required.

=cut

sub later
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $code ) = @_;

   return $self->watch_idle( when => 'later', code => $code );
}

=head2 $loop->spawn_child( %params )

This method creates a new child process to run a given code block or command.
For more detail, see the C<spawn_child> method on the
L<IO::Async::ChildManager> class.

=cut

sub spawn_child

   my $self = shift;

      $self->__new_feature( "IO::Async::ChildManager" );

   $childmanager->spawn_child( %params );
}

=head2 $pid = $loop->open_child( %params )

This creates a new child process to run the given code block or command, and
attaches filehandles to it that the parent will watch. This method is a light
wrapper around constructing a new L<IO::Async::Process> object, provided
largely for backward compatibility. New code ought to construct such an object
directly, as it may provide more features than are available here.

The C<%params> hash takes the following keys:

=over 8

=item command => ARRAY or STRING

=item code => CODE

The command or code to run in the child process (as per the C<spawn> method)

=item on_finish => CODE

A continuation to be called when the child process exits and has closed all of
the filehandles that were set up for it. It will be invoked in the following
way:

 $on_finish->( $pid, $exitcode )

The second argument is passed the plain perl C<$?> value.

=item on_error => CODE

Optional continuation to be called when the child code block throws an
exception, or the command could not be C<exec(2)>ed. It will be invoked in the
following way (as per C<spawn>)

 $on_error->( $pid, $exitcode, $dollarbang, $dollarat )

If this continuation is not supplied, then C<on_finish> is used instead. The
value of C<$!> and C<$@> will not be reported.

=item setup => ARRAY

Optional reference to an array to pass to the underlying C<spawn> method.

=back

In addition, the hash takes keys that define how to set up file descriptors in
the child process. (If the C<setup> array is also given, these operations will
be performed after those specified by C<setup>.)

=over 8

=item fdI<n> => HASH

A hash describing how to set up file descriptor I<n>. The hash may contain one
of the following sets of keys:

=over 4

=item on_read => CODE

The child will be given the writing end of a pipe. The reading end will be
wrapped by an C<IO::Async::Stream> using this C<on_read> callback function.

=item from => STRING

The child will be given the reading end of a pipe. The string given by the
C<from> parameter will be written to the child. When all of the data has been
written the pipe will be closed.

=back

=item stdin => ...

=item stdout => ...

=item stderr => ...

Shortcuts for C<fd0>, C<fd1> and C<fd2> respectively.

The command or code to run in the child process (as per the C<spawn_child>

A continuation to be called when the child process exits and closed its STDOUT
and STDERR streams. It will be invoked in the following way:

 $on_finish->( $pid, $exitcode, $stdout, $stderr )

The second argument is passed the plain perl C<$?> value.

Optional. String to pass in to the child process's STDIN stream.

=head2 $loop->resolve( %params )

This method performs a single name resolution operation. It uses an
internally-stored C<IO::Async::Resolver> object. For more detail, see the
C<resolve> method on the L<IO::Async::Resolver> class.

=cut

sub resolve
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( %params ) = @_;

   $self->resolver->resolve( %params );
}

=head2 $future = $loop->connect( %params )

This method performs a non-blocking connection to a given address or set of
addresses, returning a L<IO::Async::Future> which represents the operation. On
completion, the future will yield the connected socket handle, or the given
L<IO::Async::Handle> object.

There are two modes of operation. Firstly, a list of addresses can be provided
which will be tried in turn. Alternatively as a convenience, if a host and
service name are provided instead of a list of addresses, these will be
resolved using the underlying loop's C<resolve> method into the list of
addresses.

When attempting to connect to any among a list of addresses, there may be
failures among the first attempts, before a valid connection is made. For
example, the resolver may have returned some IPv6 addresses, but only IPv4
routes are valid on the system. In this case, the first C<connect(2)> syscall
will fail. This isn't yet a fatal error, if there are more addresses to try,
perhaps some IPv4 ones.

For this reason, it is possible that the operation eventually succeeds even
though some system calls initially fail. To be aware of individual failures,
the optional C<on_fail> callback can be used. This will be invoked on each
individual C<socket(2)> or C<connect(2)> failure, which may be useful for
debugging or logging.

Because this module simply uses the C<getaddrinfo> resolver, it will be fully
IPv6-aware if the underlying platform's resolver is. This allows programs to
be fully IPv6-capable.

In plain address mode, the C<%params> hash takes the following keys:

=over 8

=item addrs => ARRAY

Reference to an array of (possibly-multiple) address structures to attempt to
connect to. Each should be in the layout described for C<addr>. Such a layout
is returned by the C<getaddrinfo> named resolver.

=item addr => HASH or ARRAY

Shortcut for passing a single address to connect to; it may be passed directly
with this key, instead of in another array on its own. This should be in a
format recognised by L<IO::Async::OS>'s C<extract_addrinfo> method.

This example shows how to use the C<Socket> functions to construct one for TCP
port 8001 on address 10.0.0.1:

 $loop->connect(
    addr => {
       family   => "inet",
       socktype => "stream",
       port     => 8001,
       ip       => "10.0.0.1",
    },
    ...
 );

This example shows another way to connect to a UNIX socket at F<echo.sock>.

 $loop->connect(
    addr => {
       family   => "unix",
       socktype => "stream",
       path     => "echo.sock",
    },
    ...
 );

=item local_addrs => ARRAY

=item local_addr => HASH or ARRAY

Optional. Similar to the C<addrs> or C<addr> parameters, these specify a local
address or set of addresses to C<bind(2)> the socket to before
C<connect(2)>ing it.

=back

When performing the resolution step too, the C<addrs> or C<addr> keys are
ignored, and instead the following keys are taken:

=over 8

=item host => STRING

=item service => STRING

The hostname and service name to connect to.

=item local_host => STRING

=item local_service => STRING

Optional. The hostname and/or service name to C<bind(2)> the socket to locally
before connecting to the peer.

=item family => INT

=item socktype => INT

=item protocol => INT

=item flags => INT

Optional. Other arguments to pass along with C<host> and C<service> to the
C<getaddrinfo> call.

=item socktype => STRING

Optionally may instead be one of the values C<'stream'>, C<'dgram'> or
C<'raw'> to stand for C<SOCK_STREAM>, C<SOCK_DGRAM> or C<SOCK_RAW>. This
utility is provided to allow the caller to avoid a separate C<use Socket> only
for importing these constants.

=back

It is necessary to pass the C<socktype> hint to the resolver when resolving
the host/service names into an address, as some OS's C<getaddrinfo> functions
require this hint. A warning is emitted if neither C<socktype> nor C<protocol>
hint is defined when performing a C<getaddrinfo> lookup. To avoid this warning
while still specifying no particular C<socktype> hint (perhaps to invoke some
OS-specific behaviour), pass C<0> as the C<socktype> value.

In either case, it also accepts the following arguments:

=over 8

=item handle => IO::Async::Handle

Optional. If given a L<IO::Async::Handle> object or a subclass (such as
L<IO::Async::Stream> or L<IO::Async::Socket> its handle will be set to the
newly-connected socket on success, and that handle used as the result of the
future instead.

=item on_fail => CODE

Optional. After an individual C<socket(2)> or C<connect(2)> syscall has failed,
this callback is invoked to inform of the error. It is passed the name of the
syscall that failed, the arguments that were passed to it, and the error it
generated. I.e.

 $on_fail->( "socket", $family, $socktype, $protocol, $! );

 $on_fail->( "bind", $sock, $address, $! );

 $on_fail->( "connect", $sock, $address, $! );

Because of the "try all" nature when given a list of multiple addresses, this
callback may be invoked multiple times, even before an eventual success.

=back

This method accepts an C<extensions> parameter; see the C<EXTENSIONS> section
below.

=head2 $loop->connect( %params )

When not returning a future, additional parameters can be given containing the
continuations to invoke on success or failure.

=over 8

=item on_connected => CODE

A continuation that is invoked on a successful C<connect(2)> call to a valid
socket. It will be passed the connected socket handle, as an C<IO::Socket>
object.

 $on_connected->( $handle )

=item on_stream => CODE

An alternative to C<on_connected>, a continuation that is passed an instance
of L<IO::Async::Stream> when the socket is connected. This is provided as a
convenience for the common case that a Stream object is required as the
transport for a Protocol object.

 $on_stream->( $stream )

=item on_socket => CODE

Similar to C<on_stream>, but constructs an instance of L<IO::Async::Socket>.
This is most useful for C<SOCK_DGRAM> or C<SOCK_RAW> sockets.

 $on_socket->( $socket )

=item on_connect_error => CODE

A continuation that is invoked after all of the addresses have been tried, and
none of them succeeded. It will be passed the most significant error that
occurred, and the name of the operation it occurred in. Errors from the
C<connect(2)> syscall are considered most significant, then C<bind(2)>, then
finally C<socket(2)>.

 $on_connect_error->( $syscall, $! )

=item on_resolve_error => CODE

A continuation that is invoked when the name resolution attempt fails. This is
invoked in the same way as the C<on_error> continuation for the C<resolve>
method.

=head2 $loop->listen( %params ) ==> $listener

This method sets up a listening socket and arranges for an acceptor callback
to be invoked each time a new connection is accepted on the socket. Internally
it creates an instance of L<IO::Async::Listener> and adds it to the Loop if
not given one in the arguments.

Addresses may be given directly, or they may be looked up using the system's
name resolver, or a socket handle may be given directly.

If multiple addresses are given, or resolved from the service and hostname,
then each will be attempted in turn until one succeeds.

In named resolver mode, the C<%params> hash takes the following keys:

=over 8

=item service => STRING

The service name to listen on.

=item host => STRING

The hostname to listen on. Optional. Will listen on all addresses if not
supplied.

=item family => INT

=item socktype => INT

=item protocol => INT

=item flags => INT

Optional. Other arguments to pass along with C<host> and C<service> to the
C<getaddrinfo> call.

=item socktype => STRING

Optionally may instead be one of the values C<'stream'>, C<'dgram'> or
C<'raw'> to stand for C<SOCK_STREAM>, C<SOCK_DGRAM> or C<SOCK_RAW>. This
utility is provided to allow the caller to avoid a separate C<use Socket> only

In direct socket handle mode, the following keys are taken:

=over 8

=item handle => IO

The listening socket handle.

=back

In either case, the following keys are also taken:

=over 8

=item on_fail => CODE

Optional. A callback that is invoked if a syscall fails while attempting to
create a listening sockets. It is passed the name of the syscall that failed,
the arguments that were passed to it, and the error generated. I.e.

 $on_fail->( "socket", $family, $socktype, $protocol, $! );

 $on_fail->( "sockopt", $sock, $optname, $optval, $! );

 $on_fail->( "bind", $sock, $address, $! );

 $on_fail->( "listen", $sock, $queuesize, $! );

=item queuesize => INT

Optional. The queue size to pass to the C<listen(2)> calls. If not supplied,
then 3 will be given instead.

=item reuseaddr => BOOL

Optional. If true or not supplied then the C<SO_REUSEADDR> socket option will
be set. To prevent this, pass a false value such as 0.

=item v6only => BOOL

Optional. If defined, sets or clears the C<IPV6_V6ONLY> socket option on
C<PF_INET6> sockets. This option disables the ability of C<PF_INET6> socket to
accept connections from C<AF_INET> addresses. Not all operating systems allow
this option to be disabled.

=back

An alternative which gives more control over the listener, is to create the
C<IO::Async::Listener> object directly and add it explicitly to the Loop.

This method accepts an C<extensions> parameter; see the C<EXTENSIONS> section
below.

=head2 $loop->listen( %params )

When not returning a future, additional parameters can be given containing the
continuations to invoke on success or failure.

=over 8

=item on_notifier => CODE

Optional. A callback that is invoked when the Listener object is ready to
receive connections. The callback is passed the Listener object itself.

 $on_notifier->( $listener )

If this callback is required, it may instead be better to construct the
Listener object directly.

=item on_listen => CODE

Optional. A callback that is invoked when the listening socket is ready.
Typically this would be used in the name resolver case, in order to inspect
the socket's sockname address, or otherwise inspect the filehandle.

 $on_listen->( $socket )

=item on_listen_error => CODE

A continuation this is invoked after all of the addresses have been tried, and
none of them succeeded. It will be passed the most significant error that
occurred, and the name of the operation it occurred in. Errors from the
C<listen(2)> syscall are considered most significant, then C<bind(2)>, then
C<sockopt(2)>, then finally C<socket(2)>.

=head1 OS ABSTRACTIONS

Because the Magic Constructor searches for OS-specific subclasses of the Loop,
several abstractions of OS services are provided, in case specific OSes need
to give different implementations on that OS.

=cut

=head2 $signum = $loop->signame2num( $signame )

Legacy wrappers around L<IO::Async::OS> functions.

=cut

sub signame2num { shift; IO::Async::OS->signame2num( @_ ) }

=head2 $time = $loop->time

Returns the current UNIX time in fractional seconds. This is currently
equivalent to C<Time::HiRes::time> but provided here as a utility for
programs to obtain the time current used by C<IO::Async> for its own timing
purposes.

=cut

=head2 $pid = $loop->fork( %params )

This method creates a new child process to run a given code block, returning
its process ID.

=over 8

=item code => CODE

A block of code to execute in the child process. It will be called in scalar
context inside an C<eval> block. The return value will be used as the
C<exit(2)> code from the child if it returns (or 255 if it returned C<undef> or
thows an exception).

=item on_exit => CODE

A optional continuation to be called when the child processes exits. It will
be invoked in the following way:

 $on_exit->( $pid, $exitcode )

The second argument is passed the plain perl C<$?> value.

This key is optional; if not supplied, the calling code should install a
handler using the C<watch_child> method.

=item keep_signals => BOOL

Optional boolean. If missing or false, any CODE references in the C<%SIG> hash
will be removed and restored back to C<DEFAULT> in the child process. If true,
no adjustment of the C<%SIG> hash will be performed.

This method creates a new (non-detached) thread to run the given code block,
returning its thread ID.

=over 8

=item code => CODE

A block of code to execute in the thread. It is called in the context given by
the C<context> argument, and its return value will be available to the
C<on_joined> callback. It is called inside an C<eval> block; if it fails the
exception will be caught.

=item context => "scalar" | "list" | "void"

Optional. Gives the calling context that C<code> is invoked in. Defaults to
C<scalar> if not supplied.

=item on_joined => CODE

Callback to invoke when the thread function returns or throws an exception.
If it returned, this callback will be invoked with its result

 $on_joined->( return => @result )

If it threw an exception the callback is invoked with the value of C<$@>

 $on_joined->( died => $! )

=head1 LOW-LEVEL METHODS

As C<IO::Async::Loop> is an abstract base class, specific subclasses of it are
required to implement certain methods that form the base level of
functionality. They are not recommended for applications to use; see instead
the various event objects or higher level methods listed above.

These methods should be considered as part of the interface contract required
to implement a C<IO::Async::Loop> subclass.

=cut

=head2 IO::Async::Loop->API_VERSION

This method will be called by the magic constructor on the class before it is
constructed, to ensure that the specific implementation will support the
required API. This method should return the API version that the loop
implementation supports. The magic constructor will use that class, provided
it declares a version at least as new as the version documented here.

The current API version is C<0.49>.

This method may be implemented using C<constant>; e.g

 use constant API_VERSION => '0.49';

=cut

=head2 $loop->watch_io( %params )

This method installs callback functions which will be invoked when the given
IO handle becomes read- or write-ready.

The C<%params> hash takes the following keys:

=over 8

=item handle => IO

The IO handle to watch.

=item on_read_ready => CODE

Optional. A CODE reference to call when the handle becomes read-ready.

=item on_write_ready => CODE

Optional. A CODE reference to call when the handle becomes write-ready.

=back

There can only be one filehandle of any given fileno registered at any one
time. For any one filehandle, there can only be one read-readiness and/or one
write-readiness callback at any one time. Registering a new one will remove an
existing one of that type. It is not required that both are provided.

Applications should use a C<IO::Async::Handle> or C<IO::Async::Stream> instead
of using this method.

=cut

# are forced to. The constructor will be checking....

This method removes a watch on an IO handle which was previously installed by
C<watch_io>.

=over 8

=item handle => IO

The IO handle to remove the watch for.

=item on_read_ready => BOOL

If true, remove the watch for read-readiness.

=item on_write_ready => BOOL

If true, remove the watch for write-readiness.

=back

Either or both callbacks may be removed at once. It is not an error to attempt
to remove a callback that is not present. If both callbacks were provided to
the C<watch_io> method and only one is removed by this method, the other shall
remain.

=head2 $loop->watch_signal( $signal, $code )

This method adds a new signal handler to watch the given signal.

=over 8

=item $signal

The name of the signal to watch to. This should be a bare name like C<TERM>.

=item $code

A CODE reference to the handling callback.

=back

There can only be one callback per signal name. Registering a new one will
remove an existing one.

Applications should use a C<IO::Async::Signal> object, or call
C<attach_signal> instead of using this method.

This and C<unwatch_signal> are optional; a subclass may implement neither, or
both. If it implements neither then signal handling will be performed by the
base class using a self-connected pipe to interrupt the main IO blocking.

}

=head2 $id = $loop->watch_time( %args )

This method installs a callback which will be called at the specified time.
The time may either be specified as an absolute value (the C<at> key), or
as a delay from the time it is installed (the C<after> key).

The returned C<$id> value can be used to identify the timer in case it needs
to be cancelled by the C<unwatch_time> method. Note that this value may be
an object reference, so if it is stored, it should be released after it has
been fired or cancelled, so the object itself can be freed.

The C<%params> hash takes the following keys:

=over 8

=item at => NUM

The absolute system timestamp to run the event.

=item after => NUM

The delay after now at which to run the event, if C<at> is not supplied. A
zero or negative delayed timer should be executed as soon as possible; the
next time the C<loop_once> method is invoked.

=item now => NUM

The time to consider as now if calculating an absolute time based on C<after>;
defaults to C<time()> if not specified.

=item code => CODE

CODE reference to the continuation to run at the allotted time.

=back

Either one of C<at> or C<after> is required.

For more powerful timer functionality as a C<IO::Async::Notifier> (so it can
be used as a child within another Notifier), see instead the
L<IO::Async::Timer> object and its subclasses.

These C<*_time> methods are optional; a subclass may implement neither or both
of them. If it implements neither, then the base class will manage a queue of
timer events. This queue should be handled by the C<loop_once> method
implemented by the subclass, using the C<_adjust_timeout> and
C<_manage_queues> methods.

This is the newer version of the API, replacing C<enqueue_timer>. It is
unspecified how this method pair interacts with the older
C<enqueue/requeue/cancel_timer> triplet.

Reschedule an existing timer, moving it to a new time. The old timer is
removed and will not be invoked.

The C<%params> hash takes the same keys as C<enqueue_timer>, except for the
C<code> argument.

The requeue operation may be implemented as a cancel + enqueue, which may
mean the ID changes. Be sure to store the returned C<$newid> value if it is

=head2 $id = $loop->watch_idle( %params )

This method installs a callback which will be called at some point in the near

The C<%params> hash takes the following keys:

=over 8

=item when => STRING

Specifies the time at which the callback will be invoked. See below.

=item code => CODE

CODE reference to the continuation to run at the allotted time.

=back

The C<when> parameter defines the time at which the callback will later be
invoked. Must be one of the following values:

=over 8

=item later

Callback is invoked after the current round of IO events have been processed
by the loop's underlying C<loop_once> method.

If a new idle watch is installed from within a C<later> callback, the
installed one will not be invoked during this round. It will be deferred for
the next time C<loop_once> is called, after any IO events have been handled.

=back

If there are pending idle handlers, then the C<loop_once> method will use a
zero timeout; it will return immediately, having processed any IO events and
idle handlers.

The returned C<$id> value can be used to identify the idle handler in case it
needs to be removed, by calling the C<unwatch_idle> method. Note this value
may be a reference, so if it is stored it should be released after the
callback has been invoked or cancled, so the referrant itself can be freed.

This and C<unwatch_idle> are optional; a subclass may implement neither, or
both. If it implements neither then idle handling will be performed by the
base class, using the C<_adjust_timeout> and C<_manage_queues> methods.

This method adds a new handler for the termination of the given child process
PID, or all child processes.

The PID to watch. Will report on all child processes if this is 0.

=item $code

A CODE reference to the exit handler. It will be invoked as

The second argument is passed the plain perl C<$?> value.

=back

After invocation, the handler for a PID-specific watch is automatically
removed. The all-child watch will remain until it is removed by
C<unwatch_child>.

This and C<unwatch_child> are optional; a subclass may implement neither, or
both. If it implements neither then child watching will be performed by using
C<watch_signal> to install a C<SIGCHLD> handler, which will use C<waitpid> to
look for exited child processes.

If both a PID-specific and an all-process watch are installed, there is no
ordering guarantee as to which will be called first.

=head2 $loop->_manage_queues

Checks the timer queue for callbacks that should have been invoked by now, and
runs them all, removing them from the queue. It also invokes all of the
pending idle handlers. Any new idle handlers installed by these are not
invoked yet; they will wait for the next time this method is called.

=head1 EXTENSIONS

An Extension is a Perl module that provides extra methods in the
C<IO::Async::Loop> or other packages. They are intended to provide extra
functionality that easily integrates with the rest of the code.

Certain base methods take an C<extensions> parameter; an ARRAY reference
containing a list of extension names. If such a list is passed to a method, it
will immediately call a method whose name is that of the base method, prefixed
by the first extension name in the list, separated by C<_>. If the
C<extensions> list contains more extension names, it will be passed the
remaining ones in another C<extensions> parameter.

For example,

 $loop->connect(
    extensions => [qw( FOO BAR )],
    %args
 )

will become

 $loop->FOO_connect(
    extensions => [qw( BAR )],
    %args
 )

This is provided so that extension modules, such as L<IO::Async::SSL> can
easily be invoked indirectly, by passing extra arguments to C<connect> methods
or similar, without needing every module to be aware of the C<SSL> extension.
This functionality is generic and not limited to C<SSL>; other extensions may
also use it.

The following methods take an C<extensions> parameter:

 $loop->connect
 $loop->listen

If an extension C<listen> method is invoked, it will be passed a C<listener>
parameter even if one was not provided to the original C<< $loop->listen >>
call, and it will not receive any of the C<on_*> event callbacks. It should
use the C<acceptor> parameter on the C<listener> object.

=head1 STALL WATCHDOG

A well-behaved C<IO::Async> program should spend almost all of its time
blocked on input using the underlying C<IO::Async::Loop> instance. The stall
watchdog is an optional debugging feature to help detect CPU spinlocks and
other bugs, where control is not returned to the loop every so often.

If the watchdog is enabled and an event handler consumes more than a given
amount of real time before returning to the event loop, it will be interrupted
by printing a stack trace and terminating the program. The watchdog is only in
effect while the loop itself is not blocking; it won't fail simply because the
loop instance is waiting for input or timers.

It is implemented using C<SIGALRM>, so if enabled, this signal will no longer
be available to user code. (Though in any case, most uses of C<alarm()> and
C<SIGALRM> are better served by one of the L<IO::Async::Timer> subclasses).

The following environment variables control its behaviour.

=over 4

=item IO_ASYNC_WATCHDOG => BOOL

Enables the stall watchdog if set to a non-zero value.

=item IO_ASYNC_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL => INT

Watchdog interval, in seconds, to pass to the C<alarm(2)> call. Defaults to 10
seconds.

=item IO_ASYNC_WATCHDOG_SIGABRT => BOOL

If enabled, the watchdog signal handler will raise a C<SIGABRT>, which usually
has the effect of breaking out of a running program in debuggers such as
F<gdb>. If not set then the process is terminated by throwing an exception with
C<die>.
