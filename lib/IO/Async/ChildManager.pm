C<IO::Async::ChildManager> - facilitates the execution of child processes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This object is used indirectly via an C<IO::Async::Loop>:

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 use POSIX qw( WEXITSTATUS );

 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

 ...

 $loop->run_child(
    command => "/bin/ps",

    on_finish => sub {
       my ( $pid, $exitcode, $stdout, $stderr ) = @_;
       my $status = WEXITSTATUS( $exitcode );
       print "ps [PID $pid] exited with status $status\n";
    },
 );

 $loop->open_child(
    command => [ "/bin/ping", "-c4", "some.host" ],

    stdout => {
       on_read => sub {
          my ( $stream, $buffref, $eof ) = @_;
          while( $$buffref =~ s/^(.*)\n// ) {
             print "PING wrote: $1\n";
          }
          return 0;
       },
    },

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extends the functionality of the containing C<IO::Async::Loop> to
manage the execution of child processes. It acts as a central point to store
PID values of currently-running children, and to call the appropriate
continuation handler code when the process terminates. It provides useful
wrapper methods that set up filehandles and other child process details, and
to capture the child process's STDOUT and STDERR streams.

=head1 METHODS

When active, the following methods are available on the containing C<Loop>
object.

=cut

=head2 $pid = $loop->spawn_child( %params )

This method creates a new child process to run a given code block or command.
The C<%params> hash takes the following keys:

=over 8

=item command => ARRAY or STRING

Either a reference to an array containing the command and its arguments, or a
plain string containing the command. This value is passed into perl's
C<exec> function.

=item code => CODE

A block of code to execute in the child process. It will be called in scalar
context inside an C<eval> block.

=item setup => ARRAY

A reference to an array which gives file descriptors to set up in the child
process before running the code or command. See below.

=item on_exit => CODE

A continuation to be called when the child processes exits. It will be invoked
in the following way:

 $on_exit->( $pid, $exitcode, $dollarbang, $dollarat )

The second argument is passed the plain perl C<$?> value. To use that
usefully, see C<WEXITSTATUS> and others from C<POSIX>.

=back

Exactly one of the C<command> or C<code> keys must be specified.

If the C<command> key is used, the given array or string is executed using the
C<exec> function. 

If the C<code> key is used, the return value will be used as the C<exit(2)>
code from the child if it returns (or 255 if it returned C<undef> or thows an
exception).

 Case          | WEXITSTATUS($exitcode) | $dollarbang | $dollarat
 --------------+------------------------+-------------+----------
 exec succeeds | exit code from program |     0       |    ""
 exec fails    |         255            |     $!      |    ""
 $code returns |     return value       |     $!      |    ""
 $code dies    |         255            |     $!      |    $@

It is usually more convenient to use the C<open_child> method in simple cases
where an external program is being started in order to interact with it via
file IO, or even C<run_child> when only the final result is required, rather
than interaction while it is running.

=cut

sub spawn_child
{
   my $self = shift;
   my %params = @_;

   }

      $code = sub {
         no warnings;

         return;
      };
   }

      code => sub {

         close( $readpipe );

   );

   # Parent
   close( $writepipe );
   return $self->_spawn_in_parent( $readpipe, $kid, $on_exit );
}

=head2 C<setup> array

This array gives a list of file descriptor operations to perform in the child
process after it has been C<fork(2)>ed from the parent, before running the code
or command. It consists of name/value pairs which are ordered; the operations
are performed in the order given.

=over 8

=item fdI<n> => ARRAY

Gives an operation on file descriptor I<n>. The first element of the array
defines the operation to be performed:

=over 4

=item [ 'close' ]

The file descriptor will be closed.

=item [ 'dup', $io ]

The file descriptor will be C<dup2(2)>ed from the given IO handle.

=item [ 'open', $mode, $file ]

The file descriptor will be opened from the named file in the given mode. The
C<$mode> string should be in the form usually given to the C<open> function;
such as '<' or '>>'.

=item [ 'keep' ]

The file descriptor will not be closed; it will be left as-is.

=back

A non-reference value may be passed as a shortcut, where it would contain the
name of the operation with no arguments (i.e. for the C<close> and C<keep>
operations).

=item IO => ARRAY

Shortcut for passing C<fdI<n>>, where I<n> is the fileno of the IO
reference. In this case, the key must be a reference that implements the
C<fileno> method. This is mostly useful for

 $handle => 'keep'

=item fdI<n> => IO

A shortcut for the C<dup> case given above.

=item stdin => ...

=item stdout => ...

=item stderr => ...

Shortcuts for C<fd0>, C<fd1> and C<fd2> respectively.

=item env => HASH

A reference to a hash to set as the child process's environment.

=item nice => INT

Change the child process's scheduling priority using C<POSIX::nice>.

=item chdir => STRING

Change the child process's working directory using C<chdir>.

=item setuid => INT

=item setgid => INT

Change the child process's effective UID or GID.

=item setgroups => ARRAY

Change the child process's groups list, to those groups whose numbers are
given in the ARRAY reference.

On most systems, only the privileged superuser change user or group IDs.
C<IO::Async> will B<NOT> check before detaching the child process whether
this is the case.

If setting both the primary GID and the supplementary groups list, it is
suggested to set the primary GID first. Moreover, some operating systems may
require that the supplementary groups list contains the primary GID.

=back

If no directions for what to do with C<stdin>, C<stdout> and C<stderr> are
given, a default of C<keep> is implied. All other file descriptors will be
closed, unless a C<keep> operation is given for them.

If C<setuid> is used, be sure to place it after any other operations that
might require superuser privileges, such as C<setgid> or opening special
files.
