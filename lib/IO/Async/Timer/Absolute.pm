=head1 NAME

C<IO::Async::Timer::Absolute> - event callback at a fixed future time

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use IO::Async::Timer::Absolute;

 use POSIX qw( mktime );

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;

 my @time = gmtime;

 my $timer = IO::Async::Timer::Absolute->new(
    time => mktime( 0, 0, 0, $time[4]+1, $time[5], $time[6] ),

    on_expire => sub {
       print "It's midnight\n";
       $loop->stop;
    },
 );

 $loop->add( $timer );

 $loop->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This subclass of L<IO::Async::Timer> implements one-shot events at a fixed
time in the future. The object waits for a given timestamp, and invokes its
callback at that point in the future.

For a C<Timer> object that waits for a delay relative to the time it is
started, see instead L<IO::Async::Timer::Countdown>.

=cut

=head1 EVENTS

The following events are invoked, either using subclass methods or CODE
references in parameters:

=head2 on_expire

Invoked when the timer expires.

=cut

=head1 PARAMETERS

The following named parameters may be passed to C<new> or C<configure>:

=over 8

=item on_expire => CODE

CODE reference for the C<on_expire> event.

=item time => NUM

The epoch time at which the timer will expire.

=back

Once constructed, the timer object will need to be added to the C<Loop> before
it will work.

Unlike other timers, it does not make sense to C<start> this object, because
its expiry time is absolute, and not relative to the time it is started.
