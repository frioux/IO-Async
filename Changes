Revision history for IO-Async

0.02    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
         * Event methods/callback functions now called "on_*" to distinguish
           them
         * Callback functions now pass $self as first argument to simplify
           called code

        CHANGES:
         * Improved POD in Notifier.pm and Buffer.pm

        BUGFIXES:
         * GMainLoop.pm - return 1 from callbacks so that glib doesn't remove
           our IO sources
         * GMainLoop.pm - make sure re-asserting want_writeready actually adds
           the IO source again

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
