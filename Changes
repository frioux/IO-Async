Revision history for IO-Async

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Added ChildManager object
         * Added singleton storage in IO::Async::Set to store a SignalProxy or
           ChildManager conveniently

        BUGFIXES:
         * Workaround for a bug in IO::Poll version 0.05

0.04    CHANGES:
         * Added dynamic signal attach / detach methods to SignalProxy
         * Buffer now has on_read_error / on_write_error callbacks for
           handling IO errors on underlying sysread()/syswrite() calls

0.03    CHANGES:
         * No longer build_requires 'Glib' - print a warning if it's not
           installed but carry on anyway.
         * IO_Poll->loop_once() now returns the result from the poll() call
         * Added concept of nested child notifiers within Notifier object

        BUGFIXES:
         * Fix to test scripts that call IO_Poll's loop_once() with a timeout
           of zero. This can cause a kernel race condition, so supply some
           small non-zero value instead.

0.02    INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
         * Event methods/callback functions now called "on_*" to distinguish
           them
         * Callback functions now pass $self as first argument to simplify
           called code

        CHANGES:
         * Improved POD in Notifier.pm and Buffer.pm

        BUGFIXES:
         * GMainLoop.pm - return 1 from callbacks so that glib doesn't remove
           our IO sources
         * GMainLoop.pm - make sure re-asserting want_writeready actually adds
           the IO source again

0.01    First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
